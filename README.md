# MyntraWEB
This project is a front-end clone of the Myntra website, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates key sections like the homepage, product listings, and basic navigation. The goal is to practice front-end skills, focusing on responsive design, CSS layout techniques, and dynamic interactions using JavaScript.
